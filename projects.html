            I adore learning new things and am always excited for new challenges. <br>
            I'm goal-oriented and focus on always improving, and my past in OT has given me many tools for solving problems.
            Also an HTML newbie!

                My favorite aspect about programming is learning new things. I'm always enthousiastic to try out new patterns and challenges.<br>
                I find it important to communicate well, write efficient code, apply experience as you go and keep code organised.<br>
                Due to my previous background in OT I've gotten good at finding flexible and creative solutions, and I love mixing these with the logics and efficiency of gameplay programming.

            <h2>About me and my journey</h2>
            <p> Hi! I'm Seppe, a 26 year old Game Development student at Digital Arts and Entertainment. 
                I'm a last year student who has also done a bachelor in Occupational Therapy before this.
                <br>  <br>
                I started doing Occupational Therapy because I'm passionate about helping people and love to apply anything I do in a creative way.
                I've gotten experience being an OT mostly around the topics of Disabilities and Substance abuse. My years doing this have taught me invaluable skills such as teamwork, person/project based approach, flexible problem solving, and working independently.
                
                <br>  <br>
                So why am I now a Gameplay Programmer? Well as much as I loved my job, I've had an itch to do more with maths and sciences. It's something I didn't need as much in my younger years but always had a passion for.
                In a now or never moment of my life I decided to make a similar choice I made when choosing to study OT: do the creative application of my interests.
                This brought me to Digital Arts and Entertainment!

                <br>  <br>
                For the last 3 years I've been adoring every step of the way. The math is new and challenging, but gives a great motivation to put work into learning it.
                My problem solving skills help me tremendously in finding ways to fix problems and help me work on my projects.
                You could say Programming has been my passion while at school, but it truely is the learning aspect and the cognitive challenge that has kept me happy to keep on pushing through with my decision.

                <br>  <br>
                To give a summary about myself: I love challenges and learning. I want to keep improving my programming skills and focus on code-cleanliness.
                I thrive with teammates but also want responsibility for my own job.
                <br>  <br>
                If you want to know more about me or have any questions feel free to contact in the contact information at the footer of this page, or found in my resume!
            
                <br>  <br> BONUS: I love talking about literally any game or game-related topic so hit me up for that aswell!
            </p>
